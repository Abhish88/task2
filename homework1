 Negative indexing in python-
 Negative indexing starts from right of the list and starts from -1, when you dont know the length this is useful 
 as it becomes easy to refer to the last element
 
 Packing and unpacking 
 when we are not sure how many arguments need to be passed, we can use packing to pack all arguments 
 we can use * to unpack all the elements of tuple so that they can be passed as differnt parameters
 
 Mutable and Immutable
 Mutable objects are lists and dictionaries which allow to change their content and not identity
 where as objects like integers, strings, float cannot be changed so they are immutable. It will raise type error if we try to change
 
 Append and extend
 Append adds the argument as single element to the list, The lenght of list will increase by one.
 where as extend adds each element to the list, and the list extends by number of elements added.
 
 Pickling and Unpickling
 Pickling is converting object streams to byte stream, pickling is also called serialization and 
 unpickling is converting byte stream to object stream
